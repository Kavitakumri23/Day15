ðŸš€ Day 15 â€“ Sorting (Bubble Sort)
Today we started learning Sorting Algorithms.  
The first algorithm we explored is Bubble SortðŸ«§.

Algorithm Steps

1. Traverse the entire array.
2. Compare each pair of adjacent elements.
3. Swap them if they are in the wrong order.
4. After each pass, the largest element settles at the end.
5. If during a pass no swap happens â†’ the array is already sorted â†’ stop early.
